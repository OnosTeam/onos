never use zone name  that can't be directory name like "??" ... 

never call a node "raspberry_pi" or "rasberry_b_rev2" or "local" , because router is the default node

never use = inside a roomname , a room objectname or a hardware node name  onos_cmd  use it as index...


never use the char sequence:    _# , #_ , #_@   inside a object name or zone name

for now you have to create the web object with the right type...otherwise (if you change type op the webobj after the creation) you have to stop onos, to delete the html file of the room and then start onos again



never set manually a status to "onoswait"
