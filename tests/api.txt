#example1:
#localhost/onos_cmd?cmd=setSts&obj=sensor1&status=1&hw=0__  this change only the webobject,use it to change sensor value..
#example2:
#localhost/onos_cmd?cmd=setSts&obj=sensor1&status=1&hw=1__  this change both , the webobject and the hardware status if an hardware is connected to the webobject





#  localhost/onos_cmd?cmd=setNodePin&nodeSn=Plug6way0001&pin=8&status=0&hw=0__ 
#to set only the status of webobjects that are enclosed in this node and use this pin (without writing to the hardware)

#  localhost/onos_cmd?cmd=setNodePin&nodeSn=Plug6way0001&pin=8&status=0&hw=1__ 
#to set only the status of webobjects that are enclosed in this node and use this pin (writing to the hardware)
#the webobject status will change only if the write to hardware is succesfull




localhost/onos_cmd?cmd=pinsetup&node_sn=Plug6way0001&node_fw=4.85__

Return the binary representation pin mode configuration of a node from the onoscenter,this also create the node in the dictionary if it doesnt't exist yet.
This is the first query every node will make after boot , to make onos know its existence, and to know ho to setup its pins 









You could make your own pages and adding the object you want:

Copy an example page  and then modify it .

Remove <!--onos_automatic_page-->  from the page otherwise the page will be overwritten by onos

make sure to write after the " <div id="ReloadThis" >"  otherwise the html will be repeated
