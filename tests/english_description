This project name is O.N.O.S  wich stand for Open Network Object System and is an home automation system .
Using O.N.O.S. is possible to control any electric device with a single click.
The system is simple and user frendly in fact you can start using it within 5 minutes after removal from the box 
(out of the box concept).
The user only has to insert the power plug to the 'OnosCenter' (the main brain of the system) and O.N.O.S. will make all the remaing work (no configuration required).
The mission of this project is to make users (also without computer and electrical knowledge) able to install and customize their own home automation system .
Without the need to call electricians, broke the walls and rewire the house and especially without spending a pile of money.   

O.N.O.S. is modular so the user can start buying only the OnosCenter (wich allow to controll one power socket) and then he can buy only the modules needed.

The main difference between  O.N.O.S and the other automation systems is that it doesn't require using new wires or radio signals
because all the data transmission travels through the power line wires (powerline technology http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerline).
In order to use O.N.O.S. you don't have to install any software or application since the system serves a webpage wich any device having a browser will be able to displays. (phones , tablets ,pcs ebook readers and so on)

The system works also locally so without using internet you could just connect to your local network ! this feature is not avaible in the cloud based automation systems.

Another big advantage in comparison to other systems is the fully customizable interface both in the graphics and in the zones division.
Is possible to modify the colour and the shape of the buttons that control the electrical appliances( is also possible to use pictures).
The zones division is easily configurable and within few clicks the user can renames and subdivides the electrical devices in each room.

Working :
The main pc also called OnosCenter communicates through the powerline to the other nodes (wich are the O.N.O.S devices to whom the user will connect the electrical appliances) .
When the user goes to the O.N.O.S. the OnosCenter will create a webpage based on the nodes status (turned on , off ..), pressing on a button the user will be able to change the node status associated with the button.
Then the button will change text and colour in order to confirm the successful operation.
If a node was shut down or unreachable the button will show this with a gray colour , so the user will know that the transaction is pending.
This ensures the user will always know the true status of the appliances controlled.  


Technical notes (useful only to developers):


O.N.O.S. is released under open source license, this to enhance its development and to enable users to improve it further.

The software is completely free and can be run on any device wich has python so any pc with linux including the raspberry pi and BeagleBone will be fine (even on some routers with openwrt you can run it!)

No installation required, you just download the program and run it with python.

We hope to allow more people to 'play' with the internet of things for this reason the project was licensed under the open source GNU General Public License 3, which allows free use.

O.N.O.S. was developed using mainly build-in python libraries therefore does not require the installation of any additional libraries.

The  O.N.O.S. nodes are Arduino based , you can build them yourself and so easily adapt the system to your needs.
