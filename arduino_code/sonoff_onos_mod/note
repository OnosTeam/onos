Every mod done to make sonoff working with onos is commented with "onosmod".

I have modyfied only 2 files : 
sonoff.ino

user_config.h


the hardware model is selected changing:

#define MODULE                 SONOFF_BASIC // [Module] Select default model

to one of this found on sonoff_template.h:

  SONOFF_BASIC,
  SONOFF_RF,
  SONOFF_SV,
  SONOFF_TH,
  SONOFF_DUAL,
  SONOFF_POW,
  SONOFF_4CH,
  S20,
  SLAMPHER,
  SONOFF_TOUCH,
  SONOFF_LED,
  CH1,
  CH4,
  MOTOR,
  ELECTRODRAGON,
  EXS_RELAY,
  WION,
  WEMOS,
  SONOFF_DEV,
  H801,
  SONOFF_SC,
  SONOFF_BN,
  MAXMODULE


For now only SONOFF_BASIC is supported

you have to change also platformio.ini  here to use another hardware:

; Uncomment one of the lines below to build/upload only one environment
env_default = sonoff
;env_default = sonoff-touch-4ch-bnsz
;env_default = sonoff-minimal
;env_default = sonoff-ds18x20
